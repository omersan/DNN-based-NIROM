# DNN-based-NIROM
This repository contains codes for nonintrusive reduce order modeling (NIROM) based on deep neural network. The NIROM framework is based on obtaining lower order representation using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and time series prediction of modal coefficients is evaluated using deep neural network.
