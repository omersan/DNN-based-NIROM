>**Deep learning based non-intrsive reduced order model for nonlinear fluid flows**

# Abstract
In this paper, we introduce a modular deep neural network (DNN) framework for data-driven reduced order modeling of dynamical systems relevant to fluid flows. We propose various DNN architectures which numerically predict evolution of dynamical systems by learning from either using discrete state or slope information of the system. Our approach has been demonstrated using both residual formula and backward difference scheme formulas. However, it can be easily generalized into many different numerical schemes as well. We give a demonstration of our framework for three examples: (i) Kraichnan-Orszag system, an illustrative coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equation, (ii) Lorenz system exhibiting chaotic behavior, and (iii) a nonintrusive model order reduction framework for the two-dimensional Boussinesq equations with a differentially heated cavity flow setup at various Rayleigh numbers. Using only snapshots of state variables at discrete time instances, our data-driven approach can be considered truly nonintrusive since any prior information about the underlying governing equations is not required for generating the reduced order model. Our a posteriori analysis shows that the proposed data-driven approach is remarkably accurate and can be used as a robust predictive tool for nonintrusive model order reduction of complex fluid flows.
